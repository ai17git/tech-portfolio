Top performing passionate engineering manager with strengths in problem solving, leadership, strategic thinking and the ability to adapt to different situations.  

In my current role as the Director of Engineering, Automation Infrastructure & Performance Engg, for A10 networks across all product lines, I am responsible for enabling all of engineering to deliver quality reliable products that scale.

I have led a global team of 20+ automation infrastructure developers/leads/managers and performance engineers.

I consistently challenge the team to develop new automation and efficient performance infrastructure with various product requirements and bring out new tools that are useful for engineering teams; within an agile and scrum environment. 

Excellent team player, working with cross functional teams (Development, QA, Devops, PM, Marketing, Sales) to provide automation software and tools useful across the company; and providing performance benchmark of all product lines on every supported platform. 


## Current Role

# Director of Engineering, Automation Infrastructure & Performance Engineering, A10 Networks - Jan 2019 - Present

- Leading the automation infrastructure and performance teams that enable A10’s engineering to deliver quality products. 
- Infrastructure that supports orchestration and service provisioning of load-balancers (using CLI, GUI and RestApi) and servers in on-premise and public cloud environments as required for virtual/container versions of product qualification.
- Terraform integration to the infrastructure to support multiple public cloud vendors.
- Codeless automation: Integration of Behave framework to ATAF framework that removes the need to code automated test suites; thus providing the ability for engineers to automate test cases in a very short time that would otherwise take days/weeks. 
- Robust and efficient performance infrastructure that’s designed to handle high performing platforms, traffic generators that are reliable and can scale. 
- Development of code coverage computing infrastructure that works at scale. Reduced total computing time from weeks to 5 days for complete code base. Integration of the code coverage tool with the automated testing platform measures the coverage for each test-case/ test-suite/feature code change. 
- Test impact analysis tool that suggests tests to run for a section of modified code based on the code coverage report and issues reported in the past test runs for the modified code.

# Senior Engineering Manager, Automation Infrastructure & Tools, A10 Networks - Oct 2016 - Dec 2018

- Scaled infrastructure distributed across different geographical locations with more than a thousand instances of load-balancers, linux clients/servers, routers and switches with the ability to qualify a product completely in a day.
- 24 hour product release qualifying automation infrastructure that completes regression coverage in a day in virtual environment (with multiple VM hosts and VM instances) for any product line of the company. Optimized the automation coverage to effectively get the test results in a day and help qualify any release in a short time with good code coverage. 
- Scaled and distributed infrastructure running hundreds of jobs in parallel at a time on 300 DUTs covering various product features. 
  -- DUTs include hardware platforms, DUTs in virtual and container environment deployed on-premise and in public cloud infrastructure.
  -- Coverage includes system level validation, validation of complete network stack features (L2-3, L4, L7) and applications (security, firewall, analytics, logs) running on the product.
  -- Completely integrated with automated code coverage and analytical tools to report memory leaks on any DUTs running any feature test.
- Productive tools developed has been useful in early detection of critical issues that would not be possible to detect easily.
- Auto generated automation reports are delivered to customers for every code drop.
- Automation reports generated for every release; including the resource usage/memory analytics, performance reports and code coverage reports provide a concrete picture of the quality of the product at the end of a release cycle.
- In-house traffic generator orchestration. 
- Platform analytics tool using elasticsearch that dynamically polls for errors in different layers of the stack on A10’s thunder platforms and alerts the user with the error.

# Engineering Manager, Automation, A10 Networks - Feb 2014 - Sept 2016

- In-house built ATAF (ATen Automation Framework) automation framework used by every SDE team in the company for sanity and unit testing. This has had a huge impact on the code quality on completion of the development cycle.
- Infrastructure handling 1500+ test suites. Test coverage is continuously enhanced in a CI/CD process followed within the product teams. These are used to qualify all main and patch releases of all product lines at A10 today.
- Data integrity tool that validates payload of every packet passing through the device. 
- Auto-spawning of virtual-instances of servers and load-balancers.
- Tool to generate system resource capacity of all platforms of A10 that is published by the technical marketing team to be used by SEs. 
- Graphical reporting tool for memory analytics resulting in easy memory leak detection. 
- Graphical reporting tool that shows performance reports based on builds, releases and platforms.
- Customer profile automation of large ISPs and public cloud providers that auto-generate reports required by customers for every code drop. Automation of customer found defects.
- REST-API based test automation based on JSON schema in Python for all product lines. 
- TCP stack automation in Python to detect any discrepancies in the stack. The test suite also covers RFC conformance tests.
- GUI automation. Interface between automation development and infrastructure to have appropriate apis in place using Selenium tool.


# Senior Software Engineer/Technical Lead, Automation, A10 Networks - Jan 2011 - Jan 2014

- Performance automation is run on nightly builds to make sure there is no performance degradation on different platforms. This verifies the L4-L7, SSL CPS and throughput numbers. A graphical report is developed that shows different performance reports based on builds, releases and platforms.
- Automation development of feature validation for system and application level features supported on different A10’s product lines:
- Application delivery controllers - L4-7 load balancing, GSLB, TCP, UDP, Http, Caching, SSL offload, Diameter, Aflex, SNMP, Server Health Monitors, Session Management.
  -- SSLi - ADP, URL FIltering, Firewall load-balancing.
  -- CFW - SSL offload, URL Filtering, ICAP, Explicit Proxy, High Availability, Server load balancing, IPSec, WAF, CGN, IPv6 Transition, IP Anomaly detection, ALGs.
  -- IPv6 Transition - LSN, NAT64, Fixed NAT, DS-Lite, MAP-T, LW4o6, ALGs, 6rd.
